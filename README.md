# High-Level Data Access from Conceptual Models: A Forward Approach

This project demonstrates the ability to maintain the data access from the conceptual level, for projects carried out in OntoUML. Both the creation of the OntoUML model and the artifacts to access the data were produced by the plugin located at: <LINK>.

In this repository are the following artifacts:

1 - Scripts for creating two databases, one generated by the One Table per Concrete Class approach (Database script for "One Table per Concrete Class" approach) and the other by the One Table per Kind approach (Database script for "One Table per Kind" "approach);

2 - A java project to populate the data. This application simultaneously populates data in two different databases: one produced for the One Table per Concrete Class approach and the other for the One Table per Kind approach (fillDB.zip);

3 - Mapping files between the ontology and the relational scheme for Ontop:
    3.1 - for One Table per Concrete Class approach (RunExampleotpcc.obda);
    3.2 - for One Table per Kind approach (RunExampleotpk.obda);

4 - Querys Spaql for the evaluation of the proposed approach (Queries - SPARQL);
 
5 - Manual and Ontop queries for SPARQL queries:
     5.1 - for One Table per Concrete Class approach (Queries - SQL for One Table per Concrete Class);
     5.2 - for One Table per Kind approach (Queries - SQL for One Table per Kind);

6 - The measured times for manual queries and generated by the Ontop (times.xlsx Execution).
